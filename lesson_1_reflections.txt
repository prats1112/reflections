How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

-- Helped me arrive with the differences between two files faster rather than spend time on the entire file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

-- That'd help me track the changes restore any older versions faster if there was any bug in the new one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

-- you're aware of the changes made at each point as you are in control of the code unlike other platforms.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- git is only for programmers so high chances are that the files are interconnected in this case.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- get the commit ids and then use diff to understand the changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

- i could always revert back to the working copy

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
